###PROBLEM

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

###SOLUTION

class Solution(object):
    def maxArea(self, height):
        p1 = 0
        p2 = len(height) - 1
        max_area = 0
        curr_area = 0
        while (p2 > p1):
            curr_area = min(height[p1], height[p2]) * (p2 - p1)
            if (curr_area > max_area):
                max_area = curr_area
            if (height[p1] < height[p2]):
                p1+=1
            else:
                p2-=1

        return max_area

        """
        :type height: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
